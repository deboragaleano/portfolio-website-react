TEXT:

After discovering my passion for coding two years ago, I decided to make a career switch. I come from a humanities/social sciences background and I'm now interested in breaking into world of web development. 

I am open to remote entry-level positions, where I can continue working on React/NodeJs and where I can build a long-term career. 

Besides coding, I love travelling and discovering new places. I studied and lived in Europe for the past six years and now I live in Norway with my fianc√©. 

My coding language is JavaScript and my speaking languages are Spanish (native from Paraguay), English (did my BA in the US), French (studied in France for a year+) and now some Norwegian because it's the local language ;)
